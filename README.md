# Image-Classification-pipeline

This project is my attempt to solve the CS231n Image Classification pipeline

Using teh CIFAR-10 dataset, this project aims at:

1. Understanding the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.

2. Developing proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy

3. Implementing and applying a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

4. Implementing and applying a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

5. Implementing and applying a Softmax classifier

6. Implementing and applying a Two layer neural network classifier
